# ConstraintLayout Experiments

This project houses a number of Android applications which each demonstrate a particular aspect of Android's ConstraintLayout library.

The applications in this project are as follows:

* [app1](app1) – Example of how to vertically stack and horizontally align referenced widgets in a `Flow` virtual layout. 
* [app2](app2) – Example of toggling a view's width between "wrap content" and "match constraints" at runtime.
